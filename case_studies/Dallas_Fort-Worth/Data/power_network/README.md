# Power Network Data

Power network model from the [Illinois Center for a Smarter Electric Grid (ICSEG)](https://icseg.iti.illinois.edu/)'s [Texas 2000-June 2016](https://icseg.iti.illinois.edu/synthetic-power-cases/texas2000-june2016/) case.

Data on generator types compiled by the authors (thanks, Google Maps aerial imagery!).

Data on time-varying renewables availability scraped from the [Electric Reliability Council of Texas](http://www.ercot.com)'s [Grid Information](http://www.ercot.com/gridinfo). A Jupyter notebook is available in the [`renewables`](renewables) subfolder to re-collect the data.
